A website is a tool meant to serve you and will do just that if built with a goal. When getting a website, have a target that the website can help you achieve. Do not get one only because competitors have some.

Building a website is like getting an office space. You consider the location, how accessible it is to your target audience, does the appearance align with the nature of your audience? and a lot of other viable considerations.

A clear purpose is only the first requirement of an effective website. You need one more ingredient to be able to maximize the benefits you reap from a website.

## Clear Purpose + ??? = Working Content

You are browsing the web, looking for a hair product. You come across two brands that sell hair products; you have never heard of either. You decide to check out their websites.

![Brand A vs Brand B](/images/recipe-for-an-effective-website/brands.png)

- Brand A shows testimonials of past users' sentiments on their products.
- Brand B, however, features our team section but not a testimonial section.

Between a testimonial section and our team section, which do you think is a trust-building component on a website?

ðŸ‘€

The answer is both.

A testimonial section shows a user (usually positive) feedback from other people who have used your product/service. A testimonial helps build trust for almost any type of business you can think of.

Our team section favors service-oriented businesses more. It builds trust by putting faces to your service which makes it easier for people to connect with.

Although both elements help build trust with visitors, Iâ€™m guessing you care more about what other users say about the hair product than who made the productâ€”unless they are family or friends.

Brand B chose the right element for the purpose, but not necessarily the best for the product. Brand Aâ€™s testimonial section, however, reduces the level of risk you are about to take. Others have used it and are okay. You can probably use it too.

ðŸ’­ CLEAR PURPOSE + STRATEGY = WORKING CONTENT

As a business, brand, or individual thinking about getting a website, it is your job to know why you want it. However, the strategy is the responsibility of whom you choose to help you achieve your WHY; designer, developer, or agency.

A clear strategy will help you know what information to gather for the website.
