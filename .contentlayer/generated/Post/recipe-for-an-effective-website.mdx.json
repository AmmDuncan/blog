Do not get one only because competitors have some.\n\nBuilding a website is like getting an office space. You consider the location, how accessible it is to your target audience, does the appearance align with the nature of your audience? and a lot of other viable considerations.\n\nA clear purpose is only the first requirement of an effective website. You need one more ingredient to be able to maximize the benefits you reap from a website.\n\n## Clear Purpose + ??? = Working Content\n\nYou are browsing the web, looking for a hair product. You come across two brands that sell hair products; you have never heard of either. You decide to check out their websites.\n\n![Brand A vs Brand B](/images/recipe-for-an-effective-website/brands.png)\n\n- Brand A shows testimonials of past users' sentiments on their products.\n- Brand B, however, features our team section but not a testimonial section.\n\nBetween a testimonial section and our team section, which do you think is a trust-building component on a website?\n\nðŸ‘€\n\nThe answer is both.\n\nA testimonial section shows a user (usually positive) feedback from other people who have used your product/service. A testimonial helps build trust for almost any type of business you can think of.\n\nOur team section favors service-oriented businesses more. It builds trust by putting faces to your service which makes it easier for people to connect with.\n\nAlthough both elements help build trust with visitors, Iâ€™m guessing you care more about what other users say about the hair product than who made the productâ€”unless they are family or friends.\n\nBrand B chose the right element for the purpose, but not necessarily the best for the product. Brand Aâ€™s testimonial section, however, reduces the level of risk you are about to take. Others have used it and are okay. You can probably use it too.\n\nðŸ’­ CLEAR PURPOSE + STRATEGY = WORKING CONTENT\n\nAs a business, brand, or individual thinking about getting a website, it is your job to know why you want it. However, the strategy is the responsibility of whom you choose to help you achieve your WHY; designer, developer, or agency.\n\nA clear strategy will help you know what information to gather for the website.\n\n",
